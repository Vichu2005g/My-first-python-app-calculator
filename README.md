# My-first-python-app-claclator-
This is a calculator with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (there are more stuff I added. check below to see).  This is the first code i've written. 

This is not too advanced one. its really simple. Just open the python file (only with terminal not by double clicking because i found out that my script is not showing the output or answer of question) and follow the instructions of it!

And this is created to pratice programming and to create a new git hub repo. You can use it to test and you can use it for normal purpose if you want but who does it ;p.

I am also gonna add lot of features as I progress in python.

For ppl who don't know how to run python file, Download the file as zip and extract it. go to the file path on windows explorer where the clac.py file is. at top, you might see  the file path of the file. Clck that and enter cmd and you will be prompted to windows command promt. Now all you have to do is enter python clac.py ad that's it! Make sure that you have python installed on your computer. If you didn't then go to python website and download the latest version. For pictures, click this following link,
